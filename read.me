Tips about go coding:

You shouldn't experience any performance degradation by importing the `mux` library in your controller if you're already using it in `main.go`. In Go, when you import a library, it's loaded into memory only once, no matter how many times you import it across different files in the same package. What matters is how efficiently you use it in your code.

Using `mux` in your controller allows you to take advantage of its features for route and parameter handling in a more organized and readable way. Moreover, `mux` is designed to be efficient and should not cause a significant negative impact on the performance of your application.

It's common practice to separate concerns in your application, keeping the routing logic in `main.go` and the controller logic in their respective files. This helps to keep your code clean and maintainable. As long as your application is well-structured and your code is efficient, using `mux` in different parts of your application should not be a concern in terms of performance.
